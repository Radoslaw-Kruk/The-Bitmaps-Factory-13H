Some history
------------
The software was written in assembly completey by Rados≈Çaw Kruk from Poland in 2006 - 2009 years. A history of the application was started upon day in the vacation time in 2006 when I was 16 years old and trying to develop my own MS-DOS game in assembly. It was a hard work to create bitmaps for vga card manualy in the code source file. Graphics in 13H vga mode allows us to design in 320x200 screen resolution with 256 colors palete. In the day I was decided to develop a graphical application which let me create heroes and enemies for my game. In that time I was fascinated assembly language although I knew C and C++. TASM - it is a name of the assembly compiler what means Turbo Assembler. It was a part of big packet Borland Turbo C IDE for MS-DOS. It was developed for creating 16-bit application only for MS-DOS. In that time it was not the most important for me. I wanted to have a good and easily-use graphical application which generates bitmap files. Initially it was supposed to be a simple application where I could choose a color and put a pixel on the screen. Finally I wrote a whole complete graphical application (TBF13H.exe) like the Paint on Windows.

What you have in the repository
-------------------------------
  + TBF13H.EXE   - 16-bit application for MS-DOS (drag and drop to DOSBox to start)
  + TBF13H.asm   - whole old-good-school code in assembly (about 6000 lines of code)
  + Bitmap files which was generated by TBF13H as demo bitmaps files. You can load the files to the application and edit
    + ZAMEK.TXT    
    + POINT.TXT    
    + LOGO1.TXT    
    + KLEPSYDR.TXT
  + Dokumentacja.doc  - a files contains a documentation of TBF13H application in polish (if you are Polish it is worth to see this old doc)

How to use
----------
1. Drag and drop the TBF13H.EXE to DOSBox
2. Increase the Cpu speed in DOSBox above 150000 cycles (Ctrl + F12)
3. Click LMB to the DOSBox window with application intro screen
4. Click any button on your keyboard
5. Click on the "WIDTH" and enter a width of the bitmap (1 - 320)
6. Click on the "HEIGHT" and enter a height of the bitmap (1 - 200)
7. NOW YOU CAN DRAW!   (use LMB and RMB and tools of the screen intuitively)
8. To load the bitmap, click on "L" (like load) and then enter the bitmap file name (ex. ZAMEK.TXT) and press ENTER. You will see an info "file loaded successfully" then press ESC.
9. To save your own bitmap, click on "S" (like save) and then enter a new bitmap file name (ex. MY_BITMAP.TXT) and press ENTER. You will see an info "file saved successfully" then press ESC.
